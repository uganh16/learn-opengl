# OpenGL Learning Project

## Overview

This project is a hands-on implementation following the [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorial series. The goal is to learn modern OpenGL concepts through practical implementation while building a codebase that demonstrates core graphics programming techniques.

## Dependencies

+ Compiler: C++17 compatible (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
+ [CMake](https://cmake.org/): >= 3.15 (for build configuration)
+ [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/): Window/input management
+ [Assimp](https://www.assimp.org/): Model loading

## Building

```bash
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

## Running the Program

```bash
./build/opengl_app
```
